VBA Scripting Project

This script is used to go through stock market data and output a list of data showing the different tickers in the data, the yearly change of the stock, the percentage change over a year, the total stock volume moved through each ticker as well as highlighting the ticker with the greatest % increase, decrease and largest volume of stock moved through it over the time period. It can also do this for multiple sheets!
